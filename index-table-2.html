            Cascading Style Sheets, known as CSS, are an essential language for
            shaping the look and feel of websites. While HTML structures the
            content, CSS breathes life into it, transforming plain text and
            images into beautiful, engaging designs.<br /><br />
            With CSS, designers control colors, typography, spacing, and layout,
            ensuring consistency across an entire website. One of the most
            powerful aspects of CSS is the ability to create responsive designs
            that adapt to various screen sizes.

            CSS allows designers to add animations and transitions, enhancing
            user experience without relying on heavy JavaScript. Subtle effects
            like hover states, fading images, or sliding panels can make a site
            feel dynamic and professional.<br /><br />
            As CSS continues to evolve with new specifications such as CSS Grid
            and Flexbox, developers gain even more tools to build complex,
            responsive designs with clean, maintainable code.
