            Cascading Style Sheets, known as CSS, are an essential language for
            shaping the look and feel of websites. While HTML structures the
            content, CSS breathes life into it, transforming plain text and
            images into beautiful, engaging designs.<br /><br />
            With CSS, designers control colors, typography, spacing, and layout,
            ensuring consistency across an entire website. One of the most
            powerful aspects of CSS is the ability to create responsive designs
            that adapt to various screen sizes. Whether viewed on a desktop,
            tablet, or smartphone, a well-designed site remains functional and
            visually appealing, thanks to flexible units like percentages, ems,
            rems, and media queries.<br /><br />
            This adaptability has become crucial in modern web development. As
            CSS continues to evolve with new specifications such as CSS Grid and
            Flexbox, developers gain even more tools to build complex,
            responsive designs with clean, maintainable code.

            JavaScript. Subtle effects like hover states, fading images, or
            sliding panels can make a site feel dynamic and professional.
