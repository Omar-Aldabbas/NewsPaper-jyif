        <p style="font-size:20px; ">
          When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me, and the meridian sun strikes
          the upper surface of the impenetrable foliage of my trees, and but a few stray gleams
          steal into the inner sanctuary, I throw myself down among the tall grass by the
          trickling stream; and, as I lie close to the earth, a thousand unknown plants are
          noticed by me: when I hear the buzz of the little world among the stalks, and grow
          familiar with the countless indescribable forms of the insects and flies, then I feel
          the presence of the Almighty, who formed us in his own image, and the breath of that
          universal love which bears and sustains us, as it floats around us in an eternity of
          bliss; and then, my friend, when darkness overspreads my eyes, and heaven and earth
          seem to dwell in my soul and absorb its power, like the form of a beloved mistress,
          then I often think with longing, Oh, would I could describe these conceptions, could
          impress upon paper all that is living so full and warm within me, that it might be the
          mirror of my soul, as my soul is the mirror of the infinite God!

        <p style="text-align:center; border-top:2px solid black; border-bottom:2px solid black; font-size:25px; padding:10px 0;">
          The crowd seemed to grow
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:20px; ">
          The sunset faded to twilight before anything further happened. The crowd far away on
          the left, towards Woking, seemed to grow, and I heard now a faint murmur from it. The
          little knot of people towards Chobham dispersed. There was scarcely an intimation of
          movement from the pit.<br><br>
          It was this, as much as anything, that gave people courage, and I suppose the new
          arrivals from Woking also helped to restore confidence. At any rate, as the dusk came
          on a slow, intermittent movement upon the sand pits began, a movement that seemed to
          gather force as the stillness of the evening about the cylinder remained unbroken.
          Vertical black figures in twos and threes would advance, stop, watch, and advance again,
          spreading out as they did so in a thin irregular crescent that promised to enclose the
          pit in its attenuated horns. I, too, on my side began to move towards the pit.<br><br>
          Then I saw some cabmen and others had walked boldly into the sand pits, and heard the
          clatter of hoofs and the gride of wheels. I saw a lad trundling off the barrow of apples.
          And then, within thirty yards of the pit, advancing from the direction of Horsell, I
          noted a little black knot of men, the foremost of whom was waving a white flag.

          Partially, but it also obeys your commands. Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. I
          have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret
          base.<br><br>
          Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were
          killed.<br><br>
