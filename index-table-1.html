          </p>
          <p style="font-size: 20px">
            When the valley teems with vapour and the sun strikes the foliage, I
            throw myself down among the grass by the stream. A thousand unknown
            plants surround me, and the buzz of insects fills the air. I feel
            the presence of the Almighty and the breath of love around me.
            <br /><br />
            When darkness overspreads my eyes, heaven and earth seem to dwell in
            my soul, absorbing its power. I often wish I could describe these
            visions, to impress upon paper all that lives so warmly in meâ€”a
            mirror of my soul, reflecting the infinite.

            The sunset faded before anything further happened. The crowd towards
            Woking seemed to grow, and a faint murmur rose. The people near
            Chobham dispersed. There was little movement from the pit.<br /><br />
            It was this stillness that gave people courage. As dusk came on, a
            slow movement toward the sand pits began, gaining force as the
            cylinder lay silent. Figures advanced in a thin crescent to enclose
            the pit. I, too, began to move closer.<br /><br />
            Soon, cabmen and others boldly entered the sand pits, wheels
            clattered, and a lad trundled a barrow of apples. Advancing from
            Horsell, a knot of men approached, one waving a white flag.

            Partially, but it also obeys your commands. May the Force be with
            you. She is the only link to finding the Rebel base.<br /><br />
            Send a distress signal and inform the Senate that all on board were
            killed.<br /><br />
            As dusk arrived, a slow movement began around the cylinder. Figures
            advanced cautiously, forming a thin crescent around the pit. I, too,
            moved closer toward the strange object.
