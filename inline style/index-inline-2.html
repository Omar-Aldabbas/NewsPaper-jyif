          Cascading Style Sheets, known as CSS, are an essential language for
          shaping the look and feel of websites. While HTML structures the
          content, CSS breathes life into it, transforming plain text and images
          into beautiful, engaging designs.<br />
          With CSS, designers control colors, typography, spacing, and layout,
          ensuring consistency across an entire website. One of the most
          powerful aspects of CSS is the ability to create responsive designs
          that adapt to various screen sizes. Whether viewed on a desktop,
          tablet, or smartphone, a well-designed site remains functional and
          visually appealing, thanks to flexible units like percentages, ems,
          rems, and media queries.<br />
          This adaptability has become crucial in modern web development. Beyond
          layout and color, CSS allows designers to add animations and
          transitions, enhancing user experience without relying on heavy
          JavaScript. Subtle effects like hover states, fading images, or
          sliding panels can make a site feel dynamic and professional.
